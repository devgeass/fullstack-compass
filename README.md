# Full-Stack Compass by Devgeass

## What is this about?

An Instagram posts series that teaches web development from scratch. It is not a roadmap which feeds you every detail and links and resources, but rather like a compass whose aim is to point you in the correct direction. You must follow the path on your own. 

The reason to do that is also to improve your skill "to search the internet well", which, you might be surprised to know, is a necessity in life of a developer. 

Full Stack Compass is a curated list of topics which one must learn in order to gain momentum so as to pursue their career in web development.

## The Plan

The plan is to start off with **#basics** of HTML and CSS and then dive into JavaScript. As I mentioned above, I will be portraying topics that you should learn. There are tons of resources out there for you to learn from.

After **#basics**, I will be targeting separate areas like **#frontend** with React and **#backend** with NodeJS which comes with its own sort of component set. However, both of these will be working in parallel to learning **#database** skills which are of utmost importance for either field of development.

More in the future.
